Tiny code-along practice console program with the video "Coding a Windows Keylogger in C" by HirschDaniel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7SQgmwzkyE)

After copying the full code, I used ChatGPT to revise it so the code is not 100% like in the video.

Programmed in VS Code.
This program prints the characters typed on the console regardless the console being in or out of focus. Despite its name, it does not actually log anything... for now.
